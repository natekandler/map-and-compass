# Promise Middleware Example

The examples demonstrate using promise middleware to make async requests. There is a complex example that combines Redux with React and React Router. There is also a simple example with just Redux. Both examples use [a mocked JSON API](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) with [Faker data](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/).

## Getting Started
